        where s0 is the state of the simulator before executing any step, and each si with
        i >= 1 is the state of the simulator immediately after executing the i-th simulation
        step. Note that state si is obtained by calling getState() of the simulator. Note
        also that when calling this method with n < 1, the output should include s0. See
        Section 6.2 for a convenient way to print into a OutputStream.

        The 3rd parameter expOut is an InputStream that corresponds to the expected output
        or null (the same syntax as the output described above). If expOut is not null,
        first convert it into a JSON structure, and then in each simulation step you should
        compare the current state of the simulator to the expected one using the state
        comparator of the 4-th argument, and if the result is not equal throw a corresponding
        exception with a message that includes the different states and the number of the
        execution step (better create your own exception class that encapsulate all this
        information).
