Here are some exercises that you can include in your 2nd assignment if
you want:

1. Allow changing the position of a body by dragging it when the
   simulation is not running. It is very similar to the graph viewer
   example that we have seen in class, but you will have to add a
   public setPosition method to the bodies. > DONE

2. Allow changing the color of a body. For this, maintain a map in the
   Viewer class that maps bodies to colors (and use those colors in
   paintComponent), and then when the simulation is stopped, if the
   user clicks on a body open a dialog to choose a color as follows. > DONE

     // in initGUI
     chooser = new JColorChooser()

     // when the body is clicked
     Color c = chooser.showDialog(showDialog(null,"bla",Color.GREEN));
     if ( c!=null) { ...}

3. Allow adding a body, in a similar way to what we do for changing
   laws. The best is to add a method addBody(JSONObject) to the
   Controller for this, which calls the factory to create the body and
   then pass it to the simulator. > DONE

4. Allow deleting a body (open a dialog and ask the user to select a
   body from a combo box). For this you will have to add
   delBody(String) to PhysicsSimulator and also the Controller. > DONE
